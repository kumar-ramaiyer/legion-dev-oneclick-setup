# 🚀 Legion Development Environment - One-Click Setup Tool

## Overview
This PR introduces a comprehensive automation tool that transforms the Legion development environment setup from a manual 2-3 day process into a 45-90 minute automated installation.

## 🎯 Problem Solved
Previously, new developers had to:
- Follow a 30+ page README with manual steps
- Install and configure 15+ different tools manually
- Debug environment-specific issues
- Often needed help from senior developers
- Total setup time: 2-3 days

## ✨ Features Implemented

### Core Automation
- **One-click installation** - Single command `./setup.sh` does everything
- **Smart dependency resolution** - Automatically installs missing prerequisites
- **Progress tracking** - Real-time status updates with time estimates
- **Comprehensive logging** - Full execution logs for debugging
- **Error recovery** - Graceful handling of failures with rollback options

### Components Automated

#### 🐳 Docker & Containers
- Docker Desktop installation and configuration (4 CPUs, 4GB RAM, 1GB swap)
- Elasticsearch 8.0.0 container with proper network setup
- Redis master/slave containers for distributed locking
- LocalStack for AWS service emulation
- Automatic container health checks

#### 🗄️ Database Setup
- MySQL 8.0 installation via Homebrew
- Automatic database creation (legiondb, legiondb0)
- User creation with proper privileges
- **Automatic Google Drive snapshot downloads** using gdown
- Stored procedures installation
- Collation mismatch fixes
- Character set configuration (utf8mb4)

#### 🔧 Development Tools
- Java 17 (Amazon Corretto)
- Maven 3.9.9+ with JFrog Artifactory settings
- Node.js (latest) with Yarn & Lerna
- Git configuration
- SSH key generation with GitHub SAML SSO support

#### 🏗️ Build & Configuration
- Automatic Maven build (`mvn clean install -DskipTests`)
- Frontend dependency installation
- IntelliJ IDEA run configurations
- Application.yml configuration
- local.values.yml setup

### 📊 Setup Summary
At completion, displays comprehensive summary showing:
- All installed software with versions
- Running Docker containers
- Database configuration details
- Build status
- Configuration file locations
- Next steps with exact commands
- Troubleshooting guide
